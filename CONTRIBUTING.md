## Code of Conduct
We follow a simple code of conduct for all contributors:

- **Be respectful**: Treat everyone with respect and kindness.
- **Be constructive**: Provide feedback in a helpful and polite manner.
- **Collaborate**: Work together to make the project better for everyone.

## Reporting Issues
If you find a bug or have an issue with the project, please follow these steps:

1. **Check if the issue has already been reported**: Use the search feature in the GitHub Issues section to check for similar issues.
2. **Provide clear details**: When reporting an issue, please include:
   - **Steps to reproduce the issue**: Clearly describe the actions that lead to the issue. For example, "Go to the Contact Us page, leave the Email and Message fields empty, then click Submit."
   - **Expected behavior vs actual behavior**: Explain what you expected to happen and what actually happened. For example, "Expected: The form should show an error message saying 'Fields are required.' Actual: The application crashes and shows a NullPointerException."
   - **Screenshots or logs, if possible**: Provide any visuals (like screenshots) or logs that could help us understand the issue better.


## Best Practices
- **Avoid duplicates**: Before opening a new issue or pull request, please check for any existing issues or PRs that might address the same problem or feature. This helps reduce redundancy.
- **Keep it small**: If possible, make smaller and focused changes rather than big, all-encompassing ones. This makes it easier to review and merge.
- **Follow existing style**: Ensure that your code matches the existing style and conventions of the project.
- **Write tests**: If your changes affect functionality, please include tests for your changes, or at least verify the existing ones.
- **Be descriptive**: When creating a PR or issue, give as much detail as possible to help the maintainers understand the change or bug.

## Style Guidelines
Please ensure your code follows the following general conventions:

- Java classes should follow Java naming conventions.
- Code should be properly indented and formatted. If you're using IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse, you can use the auto-format tool.
- Follow the project's existing code structure and architecture.

## Testing
Make sure you test any changes you make:

- If you‚Äôre adding new features, create tests for them.
- If you‚Äôre fixing bugs, ensure that any issues are resolved without causing new ones.

## Documentation
If you make changes to the codebase, consider updating the documentation as needed. This includes README files or in-code comments.
